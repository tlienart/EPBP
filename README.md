# EPBP

## Disclaimer

This project is still under development [as of June 2015] and should be considered as such. The code is released mainly for demonstration purpose and is not claimed to be optimal but we would be grateful for your feedback.

The release [1DN](https://github.com/tlienart/EPBP) reproduces our original results and should allow one to try the method on an arbitrary graphical model with 1D continuous random variables.
